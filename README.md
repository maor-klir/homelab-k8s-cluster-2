# üè°‚ò∏Ô∏è homelab-k8s-cluster-2

My second homelab Kubernetes cluster implemented through [GitOps principles](https://opengitops.dev/) and powered by Talos Linux and Argo CD.

## üìñ Introduction

This Kubernetes cluster was concieved first and foremost for learning purposes.

My main goal is to learn how to deploy and implement each tooling i.e. technology mentioned following industry's best-practices regarding networking, identity, security, and scalability.

Secondly, I plan to self-host some applications for personal usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

- [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/): a secure, immutable, and minimal Linux distribution designed specifically for Kubernetes
- [Cilium](https://cilium.io): an eBPF-based networking, observability, and security solution for Kubernetes. Cilium serves as the cluster's [CNI](https://www.cni.dev) and [Ingress controller]((https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/))
- [Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner): dynamically provisioning persistent local storage with Kubernetes
- [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/): cloud-native certificate management for Kubernetes
- [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/): a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems (in my case, with [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/))

## üíª Underlying Infrastructure

Started out my journey hosting Kubernetes nodes on bare metal, where each node was provisioned onto a single HP EliteDesk 800 G2 DM mini PC.

Later on I have decided to transition to provisioning each node as a VM on a Proxmox VE highly available cluster.

That way, I can provision and bootstrap clusters more quickly, easily, and with less overhead.

## üó∫Ô∏è Current Environments

- talos-test - a 3-node cluster, where all testing and exploration is being made. Stable core infrastructure and workloads are being promoted to the staging environment
- talos-staging - a 3-node cluster, where all deployed workloads are stable and reliable.

**Note**: This documentation is a working document and will be updated to reflect the ongoing development of the cluster.
